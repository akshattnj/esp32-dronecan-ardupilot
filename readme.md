# ESP32 DroneCAN

This repository provides an implementation of the DroneCAN protocol for the ESP32 microcontroller. DroneCAN is a lightweight, robust, and flexible protocol designed for reliable communication in aerospace and robotics applications via CAN bus.

## Features
- **DroneCAN Protocol**: Implementation of DroneCAN for ESP32, allowing for integration with various UAV and robotics systems.
- **CAN Bus Communication**: Supports CAN communication, suitable for automotive and aerospace devices.
- **ESP32 Compatibility**: Developed specifically for the ESP32 microcontroller series, leveraging its capabilities for real-time communication.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Hardware**: An ESP32 development board (e.g., ESP32 DevKitC).
- **Software**: 
  - ESP-IDF framework installed on your system ([ESP-IDF Setup Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/)).
  - CAN transceiver module compatible with the ESP32.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Janderzon/esp32-dronecan.git
   cd esp32-dronecan
   ```
2. Configure the ESP-IDF environment:
   ```bash
   idf.py set-target esp32
   idf.py menuconfig
   ```
3. Build and flash the firmware:
   ```bash
   idf.py build
   idf.py flash
   ```

### Usage
1. Connect your CAN transceiver module to the ESP32 as per the ESP-IDF CAN documentation.
2. Power the ESP32 and monitor the output using a serial terminal (e.g., `miniterm` or `screen`).
3. Use a compatible UAV or robotics control system to interact with the ESP32 node over CAN.
